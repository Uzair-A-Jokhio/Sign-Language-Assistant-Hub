## About
SLASH is a real-time system designed for sign language gesture recognition. The application, developed using Java and Python, serves as a robust platform for creating an intuitive APP. SLASH is capable of predicting 26 classes, corresponding to the letters A through Z.

This project represents  a third-semester university endeavor, showcasing the integration of Java and Python technologies to achieve real-time sign language recognition.

# JavaFX 

Utilizing JavaFX and Scene Builder, this project aims to create an intuitive and responsive Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a Sign Language Assistant. The application consists of two main pages:

## Main Page

The Main Page features essential navigation buttons:
- **Start**: Navigate to the second page.
- **Exit**: Quit the application.

## Second Page

The Second Page provides two significant functionalities:
- **Main Page Button**: Return to the main page.
- **Begin Button**: Activate the Python script, initiating the Sign Language model.
